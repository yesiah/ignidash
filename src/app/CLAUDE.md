# Ignidash Landing Page Brief

## Overview

The landing page should make use of Tailwind Plus components (tailwindcss.com/plus). These components/UI blocks are paywalled, so when you need something you should stop and ask me to provide the relevant code.

These are the components that are available: https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks/marketing, https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks/application-ui. We want to use these resources heavily. Only if something can't use an applicable Tailwind Plus component should we build it custom. Pull data from these links so that you know what's available.

## Core Positioning

Ignidash is a next-gen FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) app that uses AI to help users explore life possibilities and make confident decisions, all rooted in their financial projections. Unlike traditional retirement calculators that end with numbers and charts, we use your financial data as a starting point to explore life possibilities, helping you discover different paths to independence and make confident decisions about major life choices. While competitors focus on complex modeling to provide the most accurate retirement results, Ignidash leans into having less complexity in terms of modeling, but more capability when it comes to planning the future and helping users make decisions aligned with their values. Our AI companion helps users discover what they actually want, explore possibilities they haven't considered, and build confidence in major life choices like career changes, house purchases, or having children.

## Target & Strategy

We serve "thoughtful optimizers" - people who want an assistant to help them make sound financial decisions when it comes to big life choices. They have money but feel paralyzed by options, seeking validation to pursue dreams beyond traditional retirement. Our initial acquisition focuses on Reddit's FIRE communities (r/financialindependence, r/Fire, r/Bogleheads) where users actively discuss alternative paths to retirement and share planning journeys. Our free Quick Plan competes with FIRE calculators but adds life path visualization (Coast FIRE, Barista FIRE, etc.) and emotional hooks ("Which path excites you?"). This creates shareable moments perfect for Reddit ("I discovered I could CoastFIRE at 40!") and natural upgrade paths to our full AI-powered product. Key differentiators: 1. From numbers to life possibilities - we go beyond charts to explore actual paths, 2. Simplicity over complexity - clear insights instead of overwhelming options, 3. AI guidance for values-based decisions vs. pure financial optimization. We explicitly avoid budgeting, expense tracking, and complex investment modeling - focusing solely on helping people discover and achieve the life they want.
