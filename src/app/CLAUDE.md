The landing page should make use of Tailwind Plus components (tailwindcss.com/plus). These components/UI blocks are paywalled,
so when you need something you should stop and ask me to provide the relevant code.

The landing page is for a next-gen FIRE (financial independece retire early) app which helps users plan the future they want with
AI. It is marketed towards "thoughtful optimizers" who want an assistant to help them make sound financial decisions when it comes
to big life choices, like a career change, house purchase, having a child, etc. Unlike other apps which focus on complex modeling
to provide the most accurate retirement results, this app will lean more into having less complexity in terms of modeling, but more
capability when it comes to planning the future, deciding the best decisions for users in terms of their values, etc.

We especially want to appeal to Reddit (r/Fire, r/Boglehead, r/financialindependence), Boglehead, Mr. Money Mustache etc. communities online.
