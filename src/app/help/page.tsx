    question: 'How should I get started with Ignidash?',
    answer: (
      <>
        If you would like to see a demo plan for Simulator to quickly explore the tool, create a new plan with the{' '}
        <strong className="underline">Demo Plan</strong> template of your choosing. This can be done with the Create button in Dashboard.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once you&apos;re ready to work on your own plan, create a new one or use the blank plan that was created automatically when you
        opened your account. I recommend customizing your Numbers with a{' '}
        <strong className="underline">Fixed Returns Simulation Mode</strong> until the Results are to your liking. After that, you can
        explore the other Simulation Modes to see how your plan performs under different market conditions and assumptions.
        <br />
        <br />
        The <strong className="underline">Monte Carlo modes</strong> are particularly useful for understanding the range of possible
        outcomes. You can drill down into full individual simulations by clicking on rows in the table at the bottom of Results.{' '}
        <strong>Tip:</strong> To find relevant simulations to explore, sort the table by metrics you care about!

    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'How can I check my vulnerability to sequence of returns risk?',
    answer: (
      <>
        You have two good options.
        <br />
        <br />
        First, you can use the <strong className="underline">Historical Returns Simulation Mode</strong> (in Simulation Settings) with{' '}
        <strong className="underline">Historical Retirement Start Year</strong> set to a historical year with a market crash, like 1929 for
        the Great Depression. This will make the market crash in your simulation at the same time as your retirement, which is the classic
        sequence of returns risk scenario.
        <br />
        <br />
        Second, you can use one of the two <strong className="underline">Monte Carlo Simulation Modes</strong> to check your Success %
        across 500 simulations. You can then drill down into failed simulations from the table at the bottom of Results by sorting by the
        Success column and clicking on one of the rows for a failed simulation. Chances are high that many of the failed simulations will
        involve market crashes early in retirement, which you can see from the Returns tab.

    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'How can I work around the lack of debt modeling?',
    answer: 'Enter your monthly debt payment as a regular expense. You can make it a monthly expense using the Frequency input.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How can I try out different options for incomes or expenses within a single Simulator plan?',
    answer:
      'You can disable (and then re-enable) individual incomes, expenses, and contributions using the Disable button in the three dot menu next to each. This keeps the data in the plan, but excludes it from the simulation results.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I choose not to automatically reinvest dividends and interest?',
    answer:
      "No. For now, Ignidash always assumes that dividends and interest are automatically reinvested, which is a common practice. There are currently no plans to change this in the future, but let me know if it's something you'd like.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why doesn't investment income, such as dividends and interest, show up in the Cash Flow tab?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Since Ignidash automatically reinvests dividends and interest, this investment income never becomes available as cash to spend;
        instead, it immediately contributes to portfolio growth. You can see this growth reflected in your account balances in the Portfolio
        tab and in the Returns tab.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you need to see investment income for tax purposes, check out the Taxes tab. And if you feel strongly about seeing investment
        income in Cash Flow, feel free to reach out through the contact info at the top of the page!
