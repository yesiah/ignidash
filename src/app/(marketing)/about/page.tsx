                . After quitting my engineering job at Meta to pursue &quot;something else&quot; (not yet knowing what that something else
                would be), I would talk to ChatGPT about my interests and finances to explore different life, career, and financial plans
                that seemed appealing.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-8">
                While these AI conversations were great for explaining retirement planning concepts and brainstorming career path ideas, I
                quickly realized that the mathematical side of financial planning was not something that LLMs were particularly well-suited
                for on their own.

              <p>
                Then, I wanted a tool that could run accurate, comprehensive long-term financial simulations to make up for the
                computational shortcomings of AI, but also had AI-powered assistance features to help me understand and interpret the
                results, as well as explore ways to fine-tune the plan according to my interests and values.
