                . After quitting my engineering job at Meta to pursue &quot;something else&quot; (not yet knowing what that would be), I
                found myself having frequent conversations with ChatGPT about career paths, life goals, and financial planning.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-8">
                While AI was excellent at explaining retirement planning concepts and brainstorming career changes that fit my interests, I
                hit a wall when it came to the math. LLMs struggle with complex financial calculations, giving me high-level ballpark
                estimates when I wanted more precision and detail.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-8">
                That&apos;s when I realized the tool I needed didn&apos;t exist yet—one that combined rigorous financial modeling with
                intelligent, conversational guidance to help me understand what the numbers actually meant for my life.

                That&apos;s when I started working on Ignidash. With Ignidash, you get comprehensive, accurate long-term financial
                simulations, plus AI assistance that helps you interpret results, explore trade-offs, and adjust your plan based on what
