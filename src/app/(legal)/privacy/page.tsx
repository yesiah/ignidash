              <p className="mb-4">
                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature
                or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
                monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been
                finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
                communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
                future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
              </p>
              <p>
                California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an
                industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.

                Under certain US state data protection laws, you can designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. We may
