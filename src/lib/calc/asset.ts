/**
 * Asset Management - Core Asset Type Definitions and Utilities
 *
 * This module provides the foundational asset class definitions and utilities for the financial
 * planning system. It defines the three core asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) and provides
 * type-safe interfaces for asset allocation, returns, and monetary value tracking.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - AssetClass union type for type-safe asset classification
 * - Asset interface with principal/growth separation for tax and reporting purposes
 * - AssetReturns and AssetAllocation types for consistent data handling
 * - Conversion utilities between user input formats and calculation formats
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Real dollar value tracking (inflation-adjusted)
 * - Principal vs. growth component separation
 * - Type-safe asset class enumeration
 * - Allocation percentage conversion utilities
 * - Integration with form inputs and calculation engine
