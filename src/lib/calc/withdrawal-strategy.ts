/**
 * Withdrawal Strategy - Retirement Portfolio Calculation Framework
 *
 * This module provides strategic calculations for determining portfolio requirements
 * based on withdrawal strategies during retirement. It implements the foundation for
 * various withdrawal methodologies that help determine how much capital is needed
 * to sustain retirement spending while accounting for taxes and safe withdrawal rates.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - Abstract class pattern for extensible withdrawal strategies
 * - Tax-aware calculations for gross withdrawal requirements
 * - Integration with safe withdrawal rate methodology
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Constant dollar withdrawal strategy implementation
 * - Tax-adjusted portfolio requirement calculations
 * - Safe withdrawal rate integration for sustainable retirement planning
 * - Extensible design for future withdrawal strategy variations

/**
 * WithdrawalStrategy - Abstract Base for Retirement Withdrawal Calculations
 *
 * Provides strategic calculations for determining the minimum portfolio size required
 * to support retirement expenses using various withdrawal methodologies. The class
 * serves as a foundation for implementing different withdrawal strategies while
 * maintaining consistent tax and safety considerations.
 *
 * Current implementation focuses on constant dollar withdrawals with safe withdrawal
 * rate methodology, commonly used in retirement planning for predictable income streams.
