/**
 * Cash Flow Components - Financial Planning Cash Flow Calculations
 *
 * This module provides a pluggable cash flow calculation system for financial planning scenarios.
 * It implements a strategy pattern where different cash flow components (income, expenses, retirement income)
 * can be calculated independently and combined to model comprehensive financial projections.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - CashFlow interface for consistent calculation strategy
 * - Year-based calculations with age-dependent logic
 * - Real vs. nominal growth rate conversions using Fisher equation
 * - Modular components for income, expenses, and retirement scenarios
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Age-dependent cash flow activation (e.g., retirement income at 62+)
 * - Inflation-adjusted real growth calculations
 * - Flexible component system for different financial scenarios
 * - Tax-adjusted retirement income calculations
