## Technical Implementation

### State Management

```typescript
interface QuickPlanState {
  // Core inputs
  currentAge: number;
  annualIncome: number;
  annualExpenses: number;
  currentNetWorth: number;

  // Growth rates (progressive disclosure)
  incomeGrowthRate: number; // default 3%
  expenseGrowthRate: number; // default 3%
  retirementExpenses?: number; // optional override

  // Asset allocation (progressive disclosure)
  stockAllocation: number; // default 70%
  bondAllocation: number; // default 30%
  cashAllocation: number; // default 0%
  stockReturn: number; // default 7%
  bondReturn: number; // default 4%
  cashReturn: number; // default 1%

  // FIRE path specific
  firePath: "traditional" | "coast" | "barista";
  targetRetirementAge?: number; // Coast FIRE only
  baristaSideIncome?: number; // Barista FIRE only

  // One-time events
  events: Event[]; // max 3

  // Settings
  safeWithdrawalRate: number; // default 4%
  inflationRate: number; // default 3%
  lifeExpectancy: number; // default 85
  displayFormat: "today" | "future"; // default 'today'
}

interface Event {
  id: string;
  type: "windfall" | "majorPurchase" | "lifeChange" | "careerBreak";
  amount: number;
  year: number;
  endYear?: number; // only for lifeChange and careerBreak
}
```

### Validation Rules

- **Real-time validation** with debounced calculations
- **Income > Expenses** warning (not blocking)
- **Asset allocation must sum to 100%**
- **Event years must be realistic** (current age + 1 to life expectancy)
- **Positive values** for all monetary inputs
- **Age ranges** enforced for all age-related inputs

### Performance Considerations

- **Debounce calculations** by 300ms on input change
- **Memoize expensive calculations** using React.useMemo
- **Virtual scrolling** for long event lists (if needed)
- **Progressive enhancement** - basic calculations work without JS

### Data Persistence

- **localStorage** for return visits
- **URL parameters** for sharing (base64 encoded state)
- **No server storage** - privacy-first approach

## Outputs Structure

### Core Design Principles for Outputs

- **Visual-first approach**: Charts before tables, overview before details
- **Progressive disclosure**: Essential info first, advanced analysis for interested users
- **Achievement celebration**: Generic handling for any already-achieved FIRE type
- **Minimal duplication**: Strategic overlap only for essential information
- **Mobile-optimized**: Touch-friendly, responsive design
- **Shareability**: Reddit-optimized results with emotional hooks

### Output Sections (Matching Input Flow)

#### 1. Results Overview

**Purpose**: Immediate gratification and key takeaways

**Components**:

- **Dynamic English hook**: Simple context-aware messaging
  - Traditional FIRE: "You could reach FI at age 42!"
  - Coast FIRE: "You're already coasting to FI!"
  - Multiple paths: "You have 3 paths to financial independence"
- **Core metrics for enabled paths**: Show essential results only
  - Years to FI
  - Age at FI
  - Net Worth needed
- **Simple achievement status**: Basic binary state
  - ✅ "Already achieved" or "X years to go"
  - No complex progress indicators or trajectory analysis
- **Share button**: Basic social sharing functionality
- **Pro upsell**: "Save and compare multiple scenarios with Pro" (subtle, contextual)

**Mobile Implementation**:

- Stack metrics vertically with good spacing and typography
- Basic share button
- Clean, minimal design without card containers

#### 2. Net Worth Chart

**Purpose**: Visual understanding of financial trajectory

**Components**:

- **Multi-path visualization**: All enabled FIRE paths on single chart
  - Traditional FIRE line
  - Coast FIRE target line (if enabled)
  - Barista FIRE transition point (if enabled)
  - **Alternative approach**: If single chart becomes cluttered (especially on mobile), implement tab-based charts where users can select specific FIRE type to view individual charts
- **Simple event markers**: Basic visual indicators showing timing
  - Windfalls (green dot)
  - Major purchases (red dot)
  - Life changes (blue dot)
  - Career breaks (orange dot)
- **Basic interactions**: Hover for event details only
- **Real-time updates**: Chart updates as users adjust inputs

- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
- **Responsive**: Standard responsive behavior

#### 3. FIRE Path Comparison Table (Conditional)

**Display Logic**: Only show when multiple FIRE paths are enabled

**Simple Table Structure**:

```
| Path Type    | Years to FI | Age at FI | Net Worth Needed | Success Rate |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|------------------|--------------|
| Traditional  | 12.3 years  | Age 42    | $1,250,000      | 87%          |
| Coast FIRE   | 8.1 years   | Age 38    | $850,000        | 95%          |
| Barista FIRE | 9.5 years   | Age 40    | $900,000        | 91%          |
```

**Note**: Status (already achieved vs years away) can be deduced from Years to FI and Age at FI columns. Alternative column option: Monthly Savings Required instead of Success Rate.

**Mobile Optimization**:

- Simple stacked cards view
- No sorting or interactive features
- Clean, readable layout

#### 4. Event Impact Summary

**Purpose**: Quantify how life events affect FIRE timeline

**Components**:

- **Individual event analysis**: Simple impact statements
  - "House down payment delays FIRE by 1.2 years"
  - "Inheritance accelerates FIRE by 3.4 years"
  - "Career break extends timeline by 2.1 years"
  - "Child expenses add 4.2 years to FIRE"
- **Cumulative effects**: "All events combined delay FIRE by 2.8 years"
- **Simple optimization suggestions** (1-2 max, rule-based):
  - "Moving house purchase 2 years later would save 8 months to FI"
  - "Timing career break after age 35 would reduce impact by 6 months"

**Event Categories**:

- **Accelerating events**: Windfalls (positive impact)
- **Delaying events**: Major purchases, career breaks, life changes (negative impact)

**Display**: Static text analysis with simple timing-focused optimization suggestions

#### 5. Success Probability & Analysis

- **Worst-case scenario context**: "In the worst historical period (Great Depression), you'd reach FI 3 years later"
- **Improvement threshold**: "Reducing expenses by $200/month would increase success to 94%"
- **Simple risk level**: Traffic light indicator
  - Green (>90%): "High confidence"
  - Yellow (70-90%): "Moderate confidence"
  - Red (<70%): "Lower confidence"

**Display**: Static analysis with no interactive elements or detailed breakdowns

#### 6. Intelligent Explanation

**Purpose**: Contextual insights and emotional engagement

**Simple Rule-Based Insights**:

- **Basic scenario detection**: High-level observations
  - Coast FIRE achieved: "You have incredible flexibility"
  - Long timeline: "Small changes can have big impact"

**Display**: Static insights with no complex personalization or detailed analysis

### Core Calculations

#### Traditional FIRE

```
FIRE Number = Annual Expenses / Safe Withdrawal Rate
Years to FIRE = Time to reach FIRE Number given:
  - Current net worth
  - Monthly savings (income - expenses)
  - Expected portfolio return
  - One-time events
```

#### Coast FIRE

```
Required Coast Amount = FIRE Number / (1 + return)^years_to_retirement
Current Coast Status = Current Net Worth >= Required Coast Amount
Years to Coast = Time to reach Required Coast Amount
```

#### Barista FIRE

```
Barista FIRE Number = (Annual Expenses - Side Income) / Safe Withdrawal Rate
Years to Barista FIRE = Time to reach Barista FIRE Number
```
