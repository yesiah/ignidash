# Self-Hosting Ignidash

Run Ignidash on your own infrastructure using Docker, including a self-hosted Convex backend.

## Setup Guide

Follow the steps below to get your app running.

### Step 1: Install Prerequisites

#### Node.js

1. Install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Verify Node.js is installed:

```bash
node --version
```

#### Docker

1. Install Docker Engine by following [the official guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. Start the Docker service on your machine
3. Verify Docker is installed and running:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

If Docker is set up correctly, this command will print a success message.

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/schelskedevco/ignidash.git
cd ignidash
```

### Step 3: Run the Setup Script

```bash
npm run selfhost -- --init
```

### Step 4: Create Your Account

Once complete, the script will display URLs for your app and Convex Dashboard.

Open the app URL (default: http://localhost:3000/signup), create an account, and you're in.

### Step 5: Enjoy!

## Docker Images

| Tag      | Description                                        |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `stable` | Latest tagged release (recommended for production) |
| `latest` | Latest commit to main branch                       |
| `vX.Y.Z` | Specific version                                   |

The default `docker-compose.yml` uses `stable`.

## Commands

| Command                           | Description                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run selfhost -- --init`      | First-time setup (creates `.env.local` from template)             |
| `npm run selfhost`                | Rebuild, restart, regenerate admin key, sync env vars, and deploy |
| `npm run selfhost -- --sync-only` | Sync env vars to Convex without rebuilding containers             |
| `npm run selfhost:convex-dev`     | Hot reload for Convex functions in development                    |
| `npm run selfhost:convex-deploy`  | Deploy Convex functions to self-hosted backend                    |
| `npm run docker:build`            | Build images (requires build context in docker-compose.yml)       |
| `npm run docker:up`               | Start services in background                                      |
| `npm run docker:down`             | Stop services                                                     |
| `npm run docker:logs`             | Stream service logs                                               |

> **Note:** `npm run selfhost` generates a new Convex admin key each run. Your Convex Dashboard credentials will change. The new key is saved to `.env.local`.

## Upgrading

```bash
git pull                 # Update app code and Convex functions
docker compose pull      # Pull latest images (app, Convex backend, and dashboard)
npm run selfhost         # Rebuild, sync env vars, and deploy
```

It's recommended to back up with `npx convex export` before upgrading. See [Convex Upgrading Guide](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-backend/blob/main/self-hosted/advanced/upgrading.md) for more.

## Change Access Method

To change your access method after setup, edit these three variables in `.env.local` and re-run `npm run selfhost` to rebuild the containers with the new URLs:

- `SITE_URL` — where the app is reachable (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:3000` or `https://mydomain.com`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` — Convex API (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:3210` or `https://api.mydomain.com`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_SITE_URL` — Convex HTTP Actions (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:3211` or `https://actions.mydomain.com`)

Always keep `CONVEX_SELF_HOSTED_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3210` — the Convex CLI runs on the host machine.

### LAN / IP Access

> **Firewall:** Ports 3000, 3210, 3211, and 6791 must be reachable from client machines. If you're running on a homelab (e.g., Proxmox, TrueNAS), check that your host firewall and any network-level rules allow traffic on these ports.

### Reverse Proxy / Custom Domain

The setup script uses `api.` and `actions.` subdomains by default. If you use different subdomains, edit the URLs above in `.env.local` after setup.

Configure your reverse proxy to forward requests to the local ports:

| Public URL                       | Target           | Notes                                |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `https://mydomain.com`           | `localhost:3000` | Ignidash app                         |
| `https://api.mydomain.com`       | `localhost:3210` | Convex API (needs WebSocket support) |
| `https://actions.mydomain.com`   | `localhost:3211` | Convex HTTP Actions                  |
| `https://dashboard.mydomain.com` | `localhost:6791` | Convex Dashboard                     |

> **Important:** The Convex API proxy (`api.mydomain.com` -> `localhost:3210`) **must** support WebSocket connections. Ensure your reverse proxy is configured for WebSocket upgrades (Nginx: `proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade` + `proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade"`, Caddy: automatic, Traefik: automatic).

## Environment Variables

### Required

| Variable                       | Description                                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `SELF_HOSTED`                  | Enables Next.js standalone output for Docker builds                            |
| `CONVEX_SELF_HOSTED_URL`       | Convex backend URL for CLI commands (default: `http://127.0.0.1:3210`)         |
| `CONVEX_SELF_HOSTED_ADMIN_KEY` | Admin key for Convex CLI and Dashboard (auto-generated by setup script)        |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`       | Convex API URL used by the browser (default: `http://localhost:3210`)          |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_SITE_URL`  | Convex HTTP Actions URL used by the browser (default: `http://localhost:3211`) |
| `SITE_URL`                     | Public URL of the application (default: `http://localhost:3000`)               |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`           | Secret for encrypting auth sessions and JWKs                                   |
| `CONVEX_API_SECRET`            | Secret for internal API authentication between services                        |

### Optional

See [Optional Environment Variables](./README.md#optional-environment-variables) for Google OAuth, Stripe, AI features, and more.

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to decrypt private key" error

This happens when `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` changes, but the database still has keys encrypted with the old secret. Common cause: running `npm run selfhost -- --init` a second time after already logging in.

To fix:

1. Open Convex Dashboard at http://localhost:6791
2. Find the `betterAuth_jwks` table
3. Delete all rows
4. Try logging in again

### Services won't start

Check which services are running and their health status:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

Then check the logs for the failing service:

```bash
docker compose logs
```

A common cause is port conflicts. These are the ports each service requires:

| Port | Service             |
| ---- | ------------------- |
| 3000 | Ignidash app        |
| 3210 | Convex backend API  |
| 3211 | Convex HTTP Actions |
| 6791 | Convex Dashboard    |

Other causes include insufficient memory or Docker not running.

### Missing environment variables in Convex

List current Convex env vars (find the admin key in `.env.local` under `CONVEX_SELF_HOSTED_ADMIN_KEY`):

```bash
npx convex env list --url http://127.0.0.1:3210 --admin-key <your-admin-key>
```

Re-sync with:

```bash
npm run selfhost -- --sync-only
```
